## Abstract :scroll: 
This summer, I was selected for GSoC to work on project Snap-package for [XWiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome).
XWiki is an open source software development platform based on the wiki principles, under the LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing effortless development of collaborative web applications. On top of this platform a plethora of applications are developed, targeted mainly on aiding enterprise-level needs.
