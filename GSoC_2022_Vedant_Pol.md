## Abstract :scroll: 
This summer, I was selected for GSoC to work on project Snap-package for [XWiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome).
XWiki is an open source software development platform based on the wiki principles, under the LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing effortless development of collaborative web applications. On top of this platform a plethora of applications are developed, targeted mainly on aiding enterprise-level needs.

## Goals :dart:
- The already existing options for xwiki installaion were tricky to update/upgrade and required much more manuall intervention. While packages that were easy to upgrade like the xwiki-debian package were not avaliable on all linux distribution .To solve this problem we could use the universal [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/). By creating a snap package of XWiki we could ensure that xwiki was avalible on all distributions and is easy to upgrade/update.
- Reaching more people/user using the snapcraft store and increasing xwiki userbase.
- Integrate the genration of snap with the release such that it is easy to maintain and provide updates.

## Results :rocket:
The [XWiki snap](https://snapcraft.io/xwiki) is published on the [snapcrat store](https://snapcraft.io/). The snap can be installed and used on all major linux distributions. The XWiki snap can be updated/upgraded without any manual interventation. 
The XWiki snap gets around **66 installs every week**. Thus increasing the XWiki users.
