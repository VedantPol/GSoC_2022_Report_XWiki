## Abstract :scroll: 
This summer, I was selected for GSoC to work on project Snap-package for [XWiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome).
XWiki is an open source software development platform based on the wiki principles, under the LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing effortless development of collaborative web applications. On top of this platform a plethora of applications are developed, targeted mainly on aiding enterprise-level needs.

## Goals :dart:
- The already existing options for xwiki installaion were tricky to update/upgrade and required much more manuall intervention. While packages that were easy to upgrade like the xwiki-debian package were not avaliable on all linux distribution .To solve this problem we could use the universal [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/). By creating a snap package of XWiki we could ensure that xwiki was avalible on all distributions and is easy to upgrade/update.
- Reaching more people/user using the snapcraft store and increasing xwiki userbase.
- Integrate the genration of snap with the release such that it is easy to maintain and provide updates.

## Results :rocket:
The [XWiki snap](https://snapcraft.io/xwiki) is published on the [snapcrat store](https://snapcraft.io/). The snap can be installed on all major linux distributions and updated/upgraded without any manual interventation. Since XWiki snap is based on the xwiki-jetty package it is fairly easy to maintain.

The XWiki snap gets around **66 installs every week** thus increasing the XWiki reach.

## Future plans :timer_clock:
The last three months of my life were unforgettable. This time was very precious to me, and I hope that it was so too
for my community. After GSoC, I would like to continue the same spirit of the contribution that I maintained during GSoC.
I would like to get involved more in the community and will be happy to guide new developers as well. I will also like
to work on some new (if any) or existing projects from my organization. In the end, I will try my best to be more 
and more helpful to the community. :innocent: If anyone wants any kind of help or wants to connect with me, then he/she is just

## Key takeaways :brain: 
There's a lot that I learned from GSoC, I mean what can be better than working on a community product that is used by
around 10k users. This is the list of my key takeaways from this program.
- Got experience of working on a community product.
- Learned lots of new things in Java, and also learned some new concepts in OOPS.
- Learned lots of new things about project management tools like Gradle and Maven and also learned about dependency management.
- Got experience developing Snap packages
- Also learned a lots about DEVOPS work flow.
- Learned about how to work in a team or with a broad community on single or multiple projects.
